# Introduction

mcmc-sampling is the final project of my course.
This project requires you to calculate the possibility
density using Monte Carlo method, providing a density function which assign to
the avegrage of two gauss function in the plane.

I choose MCMC method to deal with this task. Now MH algorithm has been implemented,
and I will add gibbs sampling algorithm if possible.

# Usage

Now this project do not read from standard input, you may test it in REPL mode.
